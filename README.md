Tired of staring at your messy diff wondering what the hell to call this commit? This bad boy analyzes your chaotic changes and gets AI to do the heavy liftingâ€”writing actual commit messages that don't suck. It's smart enough to group your scattered changes into logical commits, follows conventional commit standards _(because we're not animals)_, and can even whip up GitHub PRs with descriptions that won't make your teammates cry. Say goodbye to `wip`, `asdf`, and `checkpoint` for now. Your Git history will finally look like you know what you're doing[^1].

[^1]: Self-criticism from the creator here, I made this tool because my own Git history was a disaster. :D

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This tool depends on `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` being set. Obtain your API key at <https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey>.

## Setup

```bash
# Build it and copy to /usr/local/bin/shipit
bun run build && sudo bun run copy

# Ensure your API key is set. You can get one at <https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey>.
export GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY="..."
```

> [!TIP]
> Add an alias to your shell config file _(`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`)_ to better suit your workflow. I personally use:
>
> ```bash
> alias gca="shipit"
> ```

## Usage

```bash
shipit                    # Process all changed files
shipit index.ts utils.ts  # Process specific files

shipit --help             # Show help and every option

# Common combinations
shipit -fu                # The want to get shit done combo
shipit -y --pr            # The no time to waste combo, get it in there
```
